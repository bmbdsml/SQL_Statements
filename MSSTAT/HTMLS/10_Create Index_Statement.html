<h1 style="color:#000080;"> Create Index (Examples)</h1>
<div id="cons">
<pre>
	CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX index_name

	ON table_name (column_name1, column_name2, ...);

<b style="color:#800080;"> Example 1:  Create a Non-Clustered Index </b>

		A non-clustered index stores the index in a separate structure from the actual data, 
		
		which helps speed up queries that don't need to read all the rows of the table.

 
		<b>CREATE INDEX </b>idx_ProductName <b>ON</b> Products (ProductName);
 
		- This creates a non-clustered index named `idx_ProductName` on the `ProductName` column in the `Products` table.

<b style="color:#800080;">Example 2:  Create a Clustered Index </b>

		A  clustered index determines the physical order of the data in the table, meaning the rows are stored in the order 
		
		of the indexed column(s). 

		A table can only have one clustered index because the data can only be sorted one way.

 
	CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_ProductID ON Products (ProductID);
 
	- This creates a clustered index on the `ProductID` column in the `Products` table.

	- Since `ProductID` is likely the primary key, this will be the default clustered index unless otherwise specified.


<b style="color:#800080;"> Example 3:  Create a Unique Index </b>

			A unique index ensures that all values in the indexed column(s) are unique.
 
	CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_Products_SerialNumber ON Products (SerialNumber);
	 
		- This creates a unique index on the `SerialNumber` column in the `Products` table, 
		
		  ensuring no two products have the same serial number.

<b style="color:#800080;"> Example 4:  Create a Composite (Multi-Column) Index </b>

		A composite index is an index on multiple columns. 

		It can improve query performance for queries that filter or sort by these columns.
 
	CREATE INDEX idx_ProductName_Manufacturer ON Products (ProductName, Manufacturer);
 
	- This creates a non-clustered index on both the `ProductName` and `Manufacturer` columns in the `Products` table.
	
	- The order of the columns in the index matters, as it can affect query performance.

<b style="color:#800080;"> Example 5:  Create a Filtered Index </b>

	A filtered index is an index that only includes rows that meet a certain condition. 

	This is useful when only a subset of the data is frequently queried.
 
	CREATE INDEX idx_Products_Available ON Products (ProductName) WHERE StockQuantity > 0;

	- This creates an index on the `ProductName` column for rows where the `StockQuantity` is greater than zero.
	
	- This can improve performance for queries that only retrieve products that are in stock.

<b style="color:#800080;"> Example 6:  Create a Full-Text Index </b>

	A full-text index is used for full-text searching of textual data. 

	It allows for fast searching of large amounts of text data, such as looking for specific words or phrases.
 
	CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX ON Products (ProductDescription) KEY INDEX idx_ProductID; 

		- This creates a full-text index on the `ProductDescription` column, using the `ProductID` 
		
		  index as the key index for the full-text search.
 

<b style="color:#800080;"> Example 7:  Create a Spatial Index </b>

		A spatial index is used for columns that store spatial data (e.g., geometry or geography data types).
 
	CREATE SPATIAL INDEX idx_SpatialData ON Locations (LocationData);
 
		- This creates a spatial index on the `LocationData` column in the `Locations` table, which is useful 
		
		  for improving queries that involve geographic or geometric data.

<b style="color:#800080;"> Example 8:  Create an Index on a Computed Column </b>

	You can create an index on a computed column, which is a column defined by a calculation from other columns.

	CREATE INDEX idx_ComputedPrice ON Products (Price * Quantity);
 
	- This creates an index on a computed column that calculates the price times quantity for the `Products` table.

 <b style="color:#800080;">Example 9:  Create an Index with INCLUDE Clause </b>

	The `INCLUDE` clause allows you to include additional columns in the index, which are not part of the key, 
	
	but can help optimize certain queries that require those columns.

 	CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_Products_Name_Price ON Products (ProductName) INCLUDE (Price, StockQuantity);
 
		- This creates a non-clustered index on the `ProductName` column, but also includes `Price` 
		
		  and `StockQuantity` in the index.
		  
		- The `INCLUDE` columns are not part of the key, but can help avoid the need for SQL Server to access the table data 
		
	 	  for queries that need those columns.

<b style="color:#800080;"> Example 10:  Create a Filtered Index with Include Clause </b>

		A filtered index  with an `INCLUDE` clause can be even more efficient by creating an index that is 
		
		focused on a subset of data and includes additional non-key columns for performance.
 
	CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_ActiveProducts ON Products (ProductName) WHERE IsActive = 1 INCLUDE (Price, StockQuantity);
	

		- This creates a non-clustered filtered index on the `ProductName` column, but only includes rows where `IsActive = 1`.
		
		- It also includes `Price` and `StockQuantity` for queries that need those columns, but without requiring a table lookup.

<b style="color:#800080;"> Example 11:  Drop an Index </b>

			If you want to remove an index, you can use the `DROP INDEX` statement:

 		DROP INDEX idx_ProductName ON Products;
 
			- This removes the `idx_ProductName` index from the `Products` table.

 <b style="color:#800080;"> < Non-clustered index > </b>

	 Speeds up read operations by storing a separate index structure

 <b style="color:#800080;"> < Clustered index > </b>

	 Organizes the table data itself in a sorted order

 <b style="color:#800080;"> < Unique index > </b>

	 Ensures no duplicate values exist in the indexed columns

 <b style="color:#800080;">< Composite index ></b>

	 Indexes multiple columns together

 <b style="color:#800080;">< Filtered index > </b>

	An index on a subset of data based on a condition

 <b style="color:#800080;">< Full-text index ></b>

	 Enables full-text search capabilities

 <b style="color:#800080;">< Spatial index ></b>

	 Used for spatial data types (e.g., geographical data)

 <b style="color:#800080;"> < Include clause ></b>

	 Adds non-key columns to an index to improve query performance
